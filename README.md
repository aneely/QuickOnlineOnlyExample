# QuickOnlineOnlyExample

## A single repo might be easy to do online
Just trying something out here. This is a README that was created when I created a new repo in Github.

## Getting started
To do a quick text/markdown/etc. repo in Github, just click the `+` icon in the top right and select `New repository`. Make sure to make it private if you don't want your repo to be discoverable publically.

You'll be able to add/edit a README.md file right away and you can add .gitignore and/or a license if you're feeling fancy. If not, just skip them.

## Adding a file
I'm going to click the **add a file** button next. OK, that totally worked! I added [this file](https://github.com/aneely/QuickOnlineOnlyExample/blob/master/file_one.md) to the project.
